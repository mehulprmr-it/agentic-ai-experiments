# agentic-ai-experiments
Exploring the emerging world of Agentic AI — building, testing, and understanding autonomous AI systems that can reason, plan, and act intelligently across tasks.

This repository is a hands-on space for experimenting with Agentic AI systems, combining the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning, planning, and decision-making capabilities.

The goal is to explore how AI agents can act autonomously, interact with tools or environments, and execute multi-step tasks — from simple goal completion to complex reasoning chains.

The experiments will evolve over time, covering:

Autonomous agent frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, etc.)

Integration with APIs, external tools, and knowledge graphs

Evaluation of reasoning, adaptability, and goal-driven task completion

Mini projects demonstrating real-world agent use cases

This repo is designed to document learning progress, prototype ideas, and build intuition around how next-generation AI systems function.
